# NWAPW-Chatbot
This project was created for the NWAPW workshop. It is the root code for a very basic chatbot app, which we are also planning on making a Discord bot out of it too once the app/program is finished. This bot will work similarly to the conversational program in the game Event[0]. After the user types out a sentence, the program first runs a spellchecker to fix any typos. After that, it tries to match certain words and phrases written by the user to a large database of words grouped by tags. Then it also matches the pattern of tags to a database of tag patterns in order to come up with the best response possible. Once the closest tag pattern is identified, a pre-prepared response is chosen based on previous things that the user has said, and definitions of the words that the user typed.
